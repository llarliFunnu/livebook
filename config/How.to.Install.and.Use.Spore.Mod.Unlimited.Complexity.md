# How to Install and Use Spore Mod Unlimited Complexity
 
Spore is a 2008 simulation game that allows players to create and evolve their own creatures, civilizations, and galaxies. However, some players may find the game's complexity limit too restrictive, preventing them from making their creations as detailed and diverse as they want. Fortunately, there are mods that can remove or increase the complexity limit for all editors in Spore, such as **Spore Mod Unlimited Complexity (UPE)** [^1^] or **Spore Mod Unlimited Complexity All Editors** [^2^]. In this article, we will show you how to install and use these mods to unleash your creativity in Spore.

## What is Spore Mod Unlimited Complexity?
 
Spore Mod Unlimited Complexity is a mod that removes or increases the complexity limit for all editors in Spore, such as the creature editor, the building editor, the vehicle editor, and the spaceship editor. The complexity limit is a measure of how many parts and features you can add to your creation before it becomes too complex for the game to handle. By default, the complexity limit is shown by a bar at the bottom of the editor screen, which fills up as you add more parts. When the bar is full, you cannot add any more parts to your creation.
 
Spore Mod Unlimited Complexity removes or increases this limit, allowing you to add as many parts as you want to your creation without worrying about the bar. This way, you can make your creations more detailed, realistic, diverse, and unique. However, keep in mind that using this mod may affect the game's performance and stability, especially if you have a low-end computer or if you use too many parts. Therefore, use this mod at your own risk and discretion.
  
## How to Install Spore Mod Unlimited Complexity?
 
There are two versions of Spore Mod Unlimited Complexity: one that requires UPE (Unlimited Part Editor) and ModAPI [^1^], and one that does not [^2^]. UPE is a mod that allows you to edit parts in more ways than the default editor, such as changing their size, shape, color, texture, orientation, position, and rotation. ModAPI is a tool that allows you to install and manage mods for Spore easily. Both UPE and ModAPI are created by Zarklord.
 
To install Spore Mod Unlimited Complexity that requires UPE and ModAPI [^1^], you need to download and install UPE [^3^] and ModAPI  first. Then, download Spore Mod Unlimited Complexity (UPE) [^1^] and extract the file. Copy the MOD file to the following folders:
 
- DataEP1 (galactic adventures)
- (Origin Games\Spore Galactic Adventures for Origin)

To install Spore Mod Unlimited Complexity that does not require UPE and ModAPI [^2^], you just need to download Spore Mod Unlimited Complexity All Editors [^2^] and extract the file. Copy the MOD file to the following folders:

- DataEP1 (galactic adventures)
- (Origin Games\Spore Galactic Adventures for Origin)

Note that this version does not work for adventure editor.
